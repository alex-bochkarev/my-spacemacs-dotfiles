#+TITLE: Personal Spacemacs config (2022 revision)
#+AUTHOR: A. Bochkarev

*Key things:*
- customized orgmode, capture, and agenda
- org-roam, org-roam-protocol
- some personal snippets (yas)
- mu4e and org-msg (fixed with ver. 1.8 / new path from =mailutis=)
- python with tests (pytest) + ipython
- julia layer with a few convenience functions
- smooth window/frame motion with i3wm on ~H-h/j/k/l~
- (somewhat) quick web search
- orgmode: added =ab/jump-to-parent-and-fold= (~H-q~)
  (seems handy when editing large prose/paper in org)
- beancount for finances / expenses tracking.
