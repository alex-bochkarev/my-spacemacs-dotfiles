#+TITLE: Spacemacs config TODOs

* Current project TODOs
** TODO Maybe add beancount layer?

Would still add some usability, I guess...

What's the proper way to add it to Spacemacs?

Need to check if =file= is in =org-agenda-files= already (and add only if not)

I guess the problem is solved as long as I set up =org-agenda-files= explicitly
(not =push=-ing, but =setq=-ing).
